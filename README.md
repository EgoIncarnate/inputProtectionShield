# inputProtectionShield

The [JTAGULATOR](http://www.grandideastudio.com/portfolio/jtagulator/) took an existing project, the [JTAGENUM](https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum), and reinvented the wheel in a few places. JTAGENUM runs on Arduino, and so this shield provides the Arduino Nano with the exact same hardware capabilities as the JTAGULATOR without the heafty price tag.

These hardware capabilities inclue

* Input level conversion, including a range from 1.8-5v logic (larger range than Jtagulator)
* Input protection with current limiting and schottky diode array
